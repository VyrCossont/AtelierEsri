ESRI: Walk me through this one more time. I was promised the power to make something better than coffee, and you will deliver it unto me.

SAE: Just like with the pancakes. You know what's supposed to come out of the cauldron.

ESRI: Energy drink.

SAE: And you know what goes in.

ESRI: Mineral water. Fireweed. Cloudberries. Taun.

[Ingredients display.]

SAE: And that's from a synthesis recipe reliable enough that even I can make it. Pick up the ingredients. Smell them. Get a feel for them.

ESRI: Okay. Vibing with the ingredients. Yep, smells like fireweed. Tastes like—

SAE: Esri, stop. Stop that. Stop eating the cloudberries, you absolute redheaded bundle of impulses! *sigh* Take those out of your mouth and put everything in the cauldron.

ESRI: *munch munch* Okay, fine, we'll do it your way.

SAE: Now feel around for them with your magic. Might help if you close your eyes the first time.

ESRI: 'kaaay… *closes eyes* Hey! Sae, I got 'em.

SAE: Great! Now stir them up…

ESRI: This makes more sense than it should, but not enough to actually make sense, you know? I feel like something's missing.

SAE: Story of my life, Esri. It's not just magic, but it's too loose to be a science. Alchemy's weird. Everything's stirred up?

ESRI: Yeah. Cauldron's full of… wiggly sparks? Or at least that's what it feels like?

SAE: Hold the concept of an energy drink in your mind. Now dip a ladle in and *pull*. Imagine scooping those sparks into what should be in the ladle. Then haul them out of the quiet zone in the cauldron.

ESRI: Got it! I, uh, bucket! Get a bucket! Sae! Where do I put this?

SAE: You can open your eyes now, Esri!

ESRI: I still need a bucket!

SAE: Oh, wow, that's a lot.

ESRI: Heh. *That's what she said.*

SAE: Esri! *sighs*

ESRI: So now what?

SAE: Now we wait for it to cool, and then check that it's actually energy drink.

ESRI: Is it sometimes not energy drink? The ingredients feel like they'd only fit together wrong if you forced them.

SAE: If it gets too far from your intention, it usually explodes, or burns to ash.

ESRI: Yikes.

SAE: But I tried adding some nectar rock once, for flavor, and ended up with an excellent weatherproof gray house paint. So it's not always energy drink.

[Finished item displays.]

SAE: However, this is definitely energy drink. There's one more step, Esri: write down what you did.

ESRI: But you already have this recipe written down. How come I gotta?

SAE: In case you discover anything new. Alchemy seems to be repeatable, if not always predictable, so we write down what recipes work, and which variations. And also because you seem like the kind of girl who'll get weird stains on my books if I let her. So make your own. You get to start keeping notebooks.

ESRI: The absolute nerve. The unfairness. The slander.

ALLIE: Yeah, no, you read her right. She'll leave your stuff a mess. Esri has been borrowing manga from me since middle school and they somehow always come back covered in jam.

ESRI: A normal amount of jam!

ALLIE: No amount of jam is normal for the pages of "Princess Assassin Leda".

SAE: So is she a princess who is an assassin, or an assassin who assassinates princesses?

ALLIE: Both. Well, neither. Well, it depends on which arc. How much do you care about spoilers?

ESRI: Shut up! Have you been here the whole time?

ALLIE: I heard 'better than coffee'. I want in.

ESRI: Fine. All right, ladies. Bottoms up.

ALLIE: Cheers!

SAE: Tastes all right so far…
