ALLIE: Sae, quit grabbing my ass!

SAE: I try not to grab the asses of women I've only just met. Especially not buff women with big swords.

ALLIE: Then, Esri, knock it off! And aw, you think I'm buff?

SAE: Do you not? Have you seen yourself?

ALLIE: There's room for improvement.

ESRI: Don't bother. I've been trying to convince her that she is in fact actually righteously ripped since we were both nine. It won't stick for some reason—

SAE: Hey! What the hell? Who was that? Esri?

ESRI: Why does everyone assume I can't keep my hands to myself?

SAE: Personal experience.

ALLIE: Ohhhh. Y'all, I think it was probably one of the giant spiders.

ESRI: Giant what?

ALLIE: Spiders. You know, eight legs, buncha eyes, spins webs…

SAE: Oh. Oh, of course. We're on the south side of the Point, and this time of summer is giant spider mating season.

ESRI: It's giant spider what season?

SAE: Well, Esri, when a mommy giant spider and a daddy giant spider love each other very much, they do something that requires a lot of protein, which they get from their prey. Which is us.

ESRI: Which is us?! I don't wanna be prey!! I hate spiders!!

SAE: I'm not exactly thrilled to be realizing that a hungry spider grabbed my ass!

ALLIE: So y'all might wanna get behind me then.

ALLIE: Esri, you can stop now.

SAE: Yeah, the spiders are gone. Very gone. So is most of the ground where they used to be.

ESRI: Can't be too careful.

ALLIE: Breathe, sweetheart.

SAE: She always like this?

ALLIE: Dunno. That was probably her first fight with anything scarier than a high school bully.

SAE: Huh. I figured you two ran together. And you seem like you know your way around that sword pretty well.

ALLIE: Aw, for me, it's down to the family business. But her family's business is jewelry, not adventuring. Saw you handle your slingshot just fine, though.

SAE: I like to keep my problems at further than arm's length. Which might not be far enough, if she can make a Bomb that potent with that little practice.

ESRI: I'm right here!

SAE: Good. Yes. Hello. In combat, you are a danger to yourself and others. But I can't fault your alchemy, so we're gonna press on as soon as we pick up these bonus ingredients.

ESRI: Knew it. I'm an alchemical genius. What bonus ingredients?

SAE: Giant spider carapaces, or, well, at this point, whatever carapace fragments we can scrape up. Strong, lightweight, make for good structural components in a bunch of recipes. Not what I brought us out here to look for, but a good alchemist should always have her eyes open for possibilities.

ESRI: Oh hell no.

SAE: Oh hell yes. Here's a bag.

ESRI: I'm not doing this.

ALLIE: Esri, don't be a baby, they definitely can't hurt you now.

ESRI: Nope nope nope.

SAE: Good girls who pick up all the spider parts get to learn the recipe for Ice Bombs.

ESRI: …

SAE: Gonna be another hot day tomorrow. Plus, let's be honest with ourselves here, you definitely want to see a cryogenic explosion.

ESRI: Give me the friggin' bag.
