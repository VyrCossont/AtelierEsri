[Esri brings a party member back from "KO" status]

ALLIE: Shit, that hurt. My head feels like a bear ate it and then shat in it. I think I saw my grandma at the end of a long tunnel? And then there was this awful twisting, melting sensation…

ESRI: *wincing* Not gonna lie, you went down hard, babe.

ESRI: I got you back, though! Used a lot of materials, but it worked! I've been waiting to try this out. I call it…

ESRI: *grinning* Esriara's Advanced Extreme Trauma Field Medicinal Alchemy Technique!

SAE: Bitch, what? That wasn't field medicine. You threw her in a cauldron with a bunch of dragon steaks and some bugs and rocks and shit and started stirring until she fell apart and then somehow fell back together. I've never been exactly good at alchemy, true, but I'm concerned that you may have just invented something horrific.

ALLIE: She necromanced me! You necromanced me!

SAE: Yeah. That.

ESRI: Okay, maybe you were a little bit dead…

ALLIE: Babe, that's so fucking cool!

SAE: You two idiots deserve each other and I deserve some god damn coffee. Absolutely goodbye for today. Let's quit while we still have heads.

ESRI: Hey, so, yeah, I have bad news about the number of coffee beans currently required for Esriara's Advanced Extreme Trauma Field Medicinal Alchemy Technique…
