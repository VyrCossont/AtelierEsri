[ESRI wakes up and stretches.]

ESRI: Gods, what a night. I should tell my parents that I'm quitting the family business more often. I wonder where I am?

[SAE throws the pillow on her face onto the floor.]

SAE: Oh, I can answer that for you. You're in my bed. Now, as to the who, and the why, and the how? I'm as curious as you are to get to the bottom of those particular mysteries, half-naked stranger.

ESRI: The who is, I mean, I am Esriara Oberhauser! My friends call me Esri! I remember that much. The why is fuzzier. Mom and Dad said they were bored one cold winter night…

SAE: Esriara, why are you in my house and how did you get in here?

ESRI: Oh. The why is that I definitely shouldn't mix moonshine and pixie dust and equally definitely did, and the how is that I just end up in places when I'm turnt. It's a gift! Also your window wasn't brick-proof.

[The door slams open. ALLIE enters.]

ALLIE, cheerful: Found you! Heck, Esri, I had to check every building, barn, ditch, and well in town before I thought to try out here. What possessed you to break into the abandoned atelier?

ESRI: Moonshine and pixie dust. At least.

SAE: It's not abandoned, dipshits! It's my atelier! I live here! You. New, less-naked stranger. Is this yours?

ALLIE: Oh, yeah, we've been best friends for half of forever; this isn't the first time I've had to track her down to tell her where she woke up. And Esri, I don't think you should use her kitchen without asking.

[ESRI is doing something offscreen that's producing a lot of smoke.]

ESRI: I'm just making breakfast. When you wake up in someone's bed, it's the polite thing to do, yeah?

ALLIE: That's true…

SAE: That's weird… what are you making breakfast in? I don't have a kitchen. Oh no. Look, stay away from that, it's not for cooking—

ESRI: Pancakes!

SAE: Those… those are pancakes.

ESRI, munching: Yeah, what's the matter? They came out fine. You hungry? I made plenty.

SAE: You made them in my cauldron.

ESRI: Okay, and?

SAE: It's for alchemy, not cooking! You can't make pancakes in a cauldron!

ESRI: Huh. I mean, I just put some pancake mix in, from the jar on the shelf, and there were some berries, and—

SAE: Yeah, that jar is full of iron filings. And I don't have any berries. Although there was an old paper wasp nest up there that I hadn't gotten around to cleaning out.

ESRI: Huh.

SAE: And yet these pancakes taste just like pancakes. Actually pretty good.

ALLIE: Huh. Hers are usually pretty awful.

SAE: Esriara, I think you could be an alchemist.

ESRI: What? Me? Why?

SAE: I've studied alchemy for years, and even I can't make that thing work more than half the time!

ESRI: Wow, sucks to be you. Get good, I guess?

SAE: Maybe I don't have the talent. But apparently you do, because you just turned junk into breakfast on pure instinct. I can teach you what I do know, and then I won't have wasted all that time!

ALLIE: Plus your parents are probably never going to stop with the whole "you should do something with your life, wastrel daughter" thing, unless you get a job.

ESRI: Yes, yes, these are are all good points. How much does alchemy pay?

SAE: How about I don't kick your ass for breaking my window and invading my bed?

ESRI: All right, you have a deal!

SAE: Great. Now please put some pants on.

ESRI: That wasn't part of the deal! Now what did you say this place was called again?
